Feature: Check Care Leaver Validation for Immigration claims

  In order to submit care leaver claims
  As a provider
  I want to use the new care leaver code with an ecf reference

  @delete_outcome_after @bulkload @immas
  Scenario: Bulk load valid file for Asylum
    Given a test firm user is logged in CWA
    When user bulk loads "o_sfs_immas_stage1_lh.xml" for the test firm
    Then user should see the bulk load results page
    And successful outcomes should equal 24
    And there should be no problem outcomes

  @delete_outcome_after @bulkload @immot
  Scenario: Bulk load valid file for Immigration (non-Asylum)
