    Given a test firm user is logged in CWA
    And user prepares to submit outcomes for test provider "LEGAL HELP.IMMOT#4"

  Scenario: Add new completed matter claim when there is an existing completed matter with same UFN, UCN
    Given the following Matter Types are chosen:

      | 1 | The outcome you have entered has the same UFN as another outcome in your submission but breaks one of the following rules: All outcomes with the same UFN must be in the same category of law. UFNs can only be repeated for Immigration or Mental Health stage bills. Cases with matching UFNs must also have matching UCNs (Unique Client Numbers). Please correct your outcome so it adheres to all these rules. |
